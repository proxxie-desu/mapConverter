# Map Converter

Author: Proxxie

## Introduction

This utility converts MV map json files which had nameplates formatted for Yanfly's message core plugin (\n<Name>) to the new default format for nameplates in RPG Maker MZ. It also provides some conversion features for users of Yanfly's Message Macros plugin.

I might add some help stuff later.
